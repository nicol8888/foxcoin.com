# backend/.env

# --- GENERAL APPLICATION SETTINGS ---
# PORT: The port your backend server will run on.
PORT=3000
# NODE_ENV: The application's environment. 'development' for development, 'production' for production.
NODE_ENV=development

# --- DATABASE CONFIGURATION ---
# MONGODB_URI: The URI for connecting to your MongoDB database.
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/aurumfox

# --- SOLANA BLOCKCHAIN CONFIGURATION ---
# SOLANA_NETWORK: The Solana network your backend will connect to.
# Possible values: 'devnet', 'testnet', or 'mainnet-beta'.
SOLANA_NETWORK=devnet
# SOLANA_RPC_URL: The URL for the Solana RPC node.
# In production, it's HIGHLY recommended to use a reliable RPC provider
# like QuickNode, Alchemy, or Helius for stability and performance.
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com

# --- SECURE WALLET OPERATIONS (FOR BACKEND) ---
# IMPORTANT: NEVER STORE PRIVATE KEYS DIRECTLY IN PRODUCTION!
# This is a SERIOUS SECURITY RISK.
# For production, use a Key Management Service (KMS) such as AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS, or Azure Key Vault.
# BACKEND_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY: The backend wallet's private key in base58 encoding.
# Use ONLY for local development and testing!
# BACKEND_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_base58_encoded_private_key_for_development

# For production, instead of a private key, you will use a KMS identifier or ARN:
# BACKEND_WALLET_KMS_KEY_ID=arn:aws:kms:region:account-id:key/key-id

# --- IPFS/STORAGE CONFIGURATION (if applicable for storing NFTs or other files) ---
# If you are using an IPFS service (e.g., Pinata, Web3.Storage) for file storage:
# IPFS_API_KEY: Your API key for the IPFS service.
# IPFS_API_SECRET: Your API secret for the IPFS service.
# IPFS_API_KEY=your_ipfs_service_api_key
# IPFS_API_SECRET=your_ipfs_service_api_secret

# --- OTHER API KEYS / SECRETS (examples) ---
# JWT_SECRET: A very strong, random string for signing JSON Web Tokens (JWT), if you are using authentication.
# JWT_SECRET=a_strong_random_string_for_jwt_signing
# ADMIN_WALLETS: A comma-separated list of administrator wallet addresses for management functions.
# ADMIN_WALLETS=wallet1,wallet2,wallet3
